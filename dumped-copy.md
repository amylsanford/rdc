<h3>Seeking out collaboration</h3>
<p>To date, RDC has collaborated on performances with Northwest bands including Northwest hip-hop acts The Bad Tenants and Seattle Kokon Taiko troupe.</p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>Relay Dance Collective strives to provide professional opportunities for Northwest dancers, seek out collaboration, give back to the community, and bring new audiences and participants to the art form. Since dancing together as children, the four co-founders have formed distinct identities as women and had life experiences that add depth and soul to a strong foundation in classical ballet and modern dance. As a collective, we are no longer simply performers, but artists shaping our own work, relaying the power of dance to others.</p>
